## 1. Responsibilities

- **`mood_service.py`**:
  - Custom PyTorch 10-Class Attention BiLSTM neural network (`models/mood_analyzer/weights/emotion_model.pth`).
  - Ultra-fast CPU inference (~3–5 ms latency, ~30 MB RAM) extracting primary emotional state, confidence score, and trigger keywords.
- **`groq_service.py`**:
  - High-speed conversational AI coach powered by Groq Cloud API (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`, fallback `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`).
  - Context grounding injecting user's active goals, habit streaks, recent journals, and detected emotional pulse.
- **`roadmap_service.py`**:
  - AI learning roadmap generator utilizing Gemini Flash-Lite to produce sequential milestones with realistic durations.
  - Bidirectional progress synchronization (checking off roadmap milestones updates goal progress up to 100%) and offline curriculum fallbacks.
- **`google_calendar_service.py`**:
  - Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 integration for scheduling goal deadlines and roadmap milestone accountability events.
- **`whisper_service.py`**:
  - Encapsulates `faster_whisper.WhisperModel` initialized strictly with `model_size_or_path="tiny"`, `device="cpu"`, `compute_type="int8"`.
  - Lazy-loaded singleton; manages temporary file creation and immediate deletion in `finally` blocks.
- **`gemini_service.py`**:
  - Official `google-genai` SDK integration using `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`.
  - Structured prompt engineering: extracting mood, activities (distinguishing completed vs planned vs ongoing), blockers (categorized), and goal associations.
  - Weekly summary synthesis from in-memory records.
- **`goal_service.py`**:
  - Deterministic goal matching against user's active goals to prevent duplicate goals.
  - Priority calculation (`High Priority`, `Medium Priority`, `Low Priority`) based on completion percentage, days remaining, and estimated days.
  - Auto-synchronizes progress to 100% when goal is marked completed.
- **`progress_service.py`**:
  - Records incremental progress checkpoints with validated timestamps and ownership.
  - Calculates chronological history, step deltas (`change_from_previous`), trend direction (`Improving`, `Stagnant`, `Declining`), and average progress gain.
- **`productivity_service.py`**:
  - Computes multi-factor deterministic productivity score (0–100) combining goal completion, habit consistency, weekly progress velocity, and active blocker penalties.
- **`habit_service.py`**:
  - Single-pass habit calculation managing current streaks, completion history, and daily one-way lockouts.
- **`encryption_service.py` / `migration_service.py`**:
  - Safe, idempotent batch migration and encryption services scanning plaintext entries and converting them to AES-256-GCM ciphertext (`enc:v1:`).
  - Dry-run capability, error isolation, and detailed migration reporting.
- **`journal_service.py`**:
  - Orchestrates journal lifecycle: saving text $\rightarrow$ calling Gemini analysis $\rightarrow$ running PyTorch mood classification $\rightarrow$ matching goals $\rightarrow$ persisting structured items with AES-256-GCM encryption.
- **`summary_service.py`**:
  - Gathers user's records for on-demand weekly coaching summary generation.

## 2. Invariants & Rules

1. **4 GB RAM PC Safeguard**:
   - `whisper_service.py` must never load any model larger than `tiny`.
   - Never run simultaneous transcription jobs.
2. **Deterministic Authority**:
   - Gemini suggestions must be filtered through deterministic backend logic before mutating goal statuses or linking activities.
3. **Data Loss Prevention**:
   - If Gemini raises an exception or returns unparseable output, the journal entry must still be persisted with an `ai_analysis=None` or error placeholder. Never drop the user's reflection.
4. **Decrypted Plaintext for AI Models**:
   - All AI services (Gemini, Groq, PyTorch mood analyzer) must receive decrypted plaintext strings, never ciphertext tokens.
