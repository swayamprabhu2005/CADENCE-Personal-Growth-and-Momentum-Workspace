## 2. Invariants & Rules

1. **Real Data Exclusively**:
   - Do NOT render fake static metrics or dummy journal records.
   - If no data is available from the backend, render descriptive empty states with actionable call-to-action buttons.
2. **Asynchronous State Handling**:
   - Every page that queries the backend must handle `loading`, `error`, and `success` states gracefully.
   - Use non-blocking loading skeletons or spinners.
3. **Structured AI Rendering**:
   - The Journal page must render the structured breakdown returned by Gemini: mood with confidence, activities tagged with completion status, blockers tagged with categories, and associated goals.
